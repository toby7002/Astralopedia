# Moon

The Moon is the first extraterrestrial celestial body the player must travel to
in their Astral journey, and is the only major progression gate to unlocking
Chapter 3. The Moon is an extremely hostile yet relatively well-inhabited
environment, with many important ancient structures to explore. To survive on
the moon, a full space suit of any type must be worn, and the player should
bring plenty of spare oxygen.
