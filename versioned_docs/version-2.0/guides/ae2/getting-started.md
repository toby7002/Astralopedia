# Getting Started with AE2

_This AE2 guide was written by neijr in official wiki_

Applied Energistics 2 (also known as AE2 or simply AE) is mod that allows people
to create storage networks, also known as ME networks (often called AE networks
for simplicity).  
It also adds means of autocrafting as well as its own kind of storage, item
cells (and fluid cells for liquid materials).
