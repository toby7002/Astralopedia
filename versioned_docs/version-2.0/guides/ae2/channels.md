# Channels

ME networks have limited number of channels. It means that adding devices to
network won't do anything at some point as they can't get their own channel.  
In networks without controllers (see chapter 6 for more information about them)
connecting more devices that there are channels available will shut down entire
network.  
In networks with controllers channels are distributed from controllers starting
with closest, and so devices connected to cable with no free channels will
either not work because of not having channel or will take channel from device
further from controller.
