# Infinite Liquid

_This guide was written by Ethanicuss, NikWas in official wiki_

Infinite Liquids, especially lava, are essential to mid-game and late-game in
astral. A lake of liquid with a minimum volume of 10,000 liquid blocks counts as
infinite. An attached hose pulley, when set up properly, will be able to take
out an infinite amount of liquid from a pool of this size.

## The set up

Got the liquid? What now?

Make sure the liquid lake is at least 10,001 blocks in volume. Lower hose pulley
by 1 block. Pump into the hose pulley until it says "bottomless" while looking
with goggles equipped. Once bottomless, lower the hose pulley all the way down.
Once all the way down, you will lose bottomless. Continue pumping INTO until the
pulley shows "bottomless" again. Once the hose pulley is at the bottommost block
and is bottomless, you can now pump OUT.

## Troubleshooting

Bottomless, but is still draining:

Is the Hose Pulley touching the bottom most block of the hole? Is the Hole
spread across several chunks?

## Gathering 10k liquid blocks

For this part, it would be helpful to gain an understanding of AE2.

## Tricks

The fastest way to get 10k lava blocks is pumping it from the lava lakes under
the Moon. If you're lucky, you might hit an infinite lava lake (10,001+ blocks).
