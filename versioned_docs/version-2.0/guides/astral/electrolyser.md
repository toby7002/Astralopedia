# The Electrolyser Multiblock - Obtaining Oxygen

_This guide was written by therobbie72 in official wiki_

You will need to produce oxygen to breathe while on the moon. Oxygen is produced
by the Electrolyser multiblock.

> The Oxygen Loader from Ad Astra will NOT produce oxygen from water. The Oxygen
> Loader is used to transfer oxygen into space suits and oxygen tanks. Oxygen
> must be pumped into the Oxygen Loader using Create pipes

**NOTE**: Because the Oxygen Loader only transfers oxygen, it does NOT require
power. The Electrolyser multiblock takes a 3x3x3 space and consists of 3
different blocks: Electrolyser (Custom Machinery), Copper Casing (Create), and
Copper Coil Block (createastral). These blocks are built into the following
configuration:

The Electrolyser block will have two visible holes; one in front, and one below.
Water can be pumped into one of these holes, and the oxygen produced can be
pumped out of the other.
